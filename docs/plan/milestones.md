# Milestones

This is the single status surface. Each line follows `<id> <slug> — <status> — <appetite>[ — <note>]`. Status is one of `shaped`, `active`, `later`, `done`, `cut`, or `reshaped`; `later` means shaped and funded but sequenced behind the chain in flight, a `cut` note names what was cut, and a `reshaped` note names the successor id.
